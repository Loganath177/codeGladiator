This program is a simple calculator that reads its input from a character buffer. If integers are read, they are pushed on a stack. If one of the operators (+ - * ‚ÅÑ) is read, the top two elements are popped off the stack, the operation is performed on them, and the result is pushed on the stack. The = operator writes out the value of the top element of the stack to a buffer.
